$Format:%(describe:match=v*)$


# The format string above is expanded with values during the execution of
# 	git archive
# if the `export-subst` "hook" is in `.gitattributes`.
# This is what GitHub appears to do when creating a release.
# Format tokens (`%..`) are replaced like those for
# 	git log --format=format:"..."
# See
# 	https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats
